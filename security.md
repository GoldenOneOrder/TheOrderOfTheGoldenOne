**Smart Contracts**

All our smart contracts, balances and liquidity lock are publicly available, and verifiable. [You can review this section for more details](broken-reference).

**Auditing**

In-house audits and quality assurance process aside, the Universe team is always looking to get additional audits to ensure that the contracts are constantly being reviewed and are as secure as possible. We are looking forward to making our first public audit by the end of Q3 2022.

**Anonymity**

We have pushed considerable efforts in making each member of our team anonymous as well. Our reasons are simple:

* We don't want fame but make a difference
* We want Universe to be faceless, ultimately being entirely autonomous and decentralized
* We want to protect the team from extortion and kidnapping
