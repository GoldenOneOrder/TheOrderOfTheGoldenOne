# ðŸ’µ Fees

To make the protocol sustain and start earning yield for the community, the project has to take fees.The current liquidity fees are as below:

* **28%** of the reward generated for every compound
* **28%** of the reward claimed
* **28%** of the amount per grade creation

| Project                                           | Fee Allocation                                                                                                                          | Compound/Reward Allocation |
| ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| The Order                                         | <mark style="color:green;">**28% Treasury (as liquidity, delayed) + 72% burned**</mark>                                                 | 28%                        |
| <mark style="color:red;">Other Node Tokens</mark> | <mark style="color:red;">**100% Treasury (dumped instantly**</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">ðŸ’€)</mark> | Mostly between 10-30%      |

The generated liquidity through fees is then automatically split into the following:

* Treasury Investments to grow treasury and earn yield (30%)â€‹
* Project Development and Funding (30%)
* Marketing (30%)
* Carbon Credits (10%)

We will add liquidity every time a certain threshold is met. UNIV did 10M & 100M and we will follow similar thresholds, or adjust depending on the value of KIN.
