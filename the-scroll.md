### Burn your token to enter a Grade

Different from other "node token' protocols where 100% of the funds are sent to the treasury before rewards are distributed, only 28% of KIN is added as liquidity to the treasury when joining the order. The remaining 78% is burned.. keeping the supply of KIN scarce and the value of KIN high.

### Earn Eternally

Previously, nodes couldn't be transferred, bought, or sold on the market.&#x20;

The Order's protocol adds the ERC-721 standard to the Node concept where they can be transferred, exchanged, and traded outside the main KIN token.

Their lifetime rewards can always be redeemed to KIN tokens **instantly.**

### Maintain the Order

Instead of massive micro-sells triggered by compounding/reward claims, followed by another set of 4-5 big automated sells for each node creation on the trading chart to fill the treasury like every competitor _as described in the (terrible) Ring Financial standard_, we manually remove part of the liquidity that is generated and sent to us through the fees.&#x20;

### Set a Limit

Smart Daily Limits are innovations to keep liquidity pools safer from bots and vicious whales, making the Temple Kin token the safest node-type of token to hold. Wallets are limited to only accumulating a number of tokens per day. They can always sell what they have bought at any time which allows swing trading. They can always safely claim rewards of the planet(s) but transferring or selling them more than the daily limit will require them to wait the next day. This way, no one can buy a significant part of the supply on launch and no one can sell a significant amount of rewards at once.&#x20;

### OPTIMISED FOR PERFORMANCE, RELIABILITY AND SECURITY

The contract has been rewritten from the ground up to keep in mind the performance, security, reliability, and clarity of code
