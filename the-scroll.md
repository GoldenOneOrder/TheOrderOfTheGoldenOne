### FORFEIT YOUR COIN TO JOIN THE ORDER

Different from other "node token' protocols where 100% of the funds are sent to the treasury before rewards are distributed, only 28% of KIN is added as liquidity to the treasury when joining the order. The remaining 78% is burned.. keeping the supply of KIN scarce and the value of KIN high.

### A NFT THAT EARNS PERPETUAL REWARDS

Previously, nodes couldn't be transferred, bought, or sold on the market.&#x20;

The Order's protocol adds the ERC-721 standard to the Node concept where they can be transferred, exchanged, and traded outside the main GLDN token.

Their lifetime rewards can always be redeemed to GLDN tokens **instantly.**

### INTELLIGENT LIQUIDITY & TREASURY MANAGEMENT

Instead of massive micro-sells triggered by compounding/reward claims, followed by another set of 4-5 big automated sells for each node creation on the trading chart to fill the treasury like every competitor _as described in the (terrible) Ring Financial standard_, we manually remove part of the liquidity that is generated and sent to us through the fees.&#x20;

### SMART DAILY LIMITS

Smart Daily Limits are part of the Order's innovations to keep liquidity pools safer from bots and vicious whales, making the Golden One token the safest node-type of token to hold. Wallets are limited to only accumulating a number of tokens per day. They can always sell what they have bought at any time which allows swing trading. They can always safely claim rewards of the planet(s) but transferring or selling them more than the daily limit will require them to wait the next day. This way, no one can buy a significant part of the supply on launch and no one can sell a significant amount of rewards at once. [More details can be found here.](broken-reference)

The total supply is 42 billion GLDN tokens. The launch price is 42B tokens for $10,000 ($0,000000238095238 per GLDN). 100% of the liquidity were added during the fair launch, on 01/25/22. The minimum to create a Planet at launch is 42,000 UNIV ($0,01). With the [burn mechanism](https://docs.univ.money/what-is-universe/the-solution#burn-your-coins-to-build-a-planet), it makes the supply elastic based on the supply and the demand. A portion of the liquidity is reserved for yield farming and staking across multiple [selected products](https://docs.univ.money/technical-details/supported-protocols) whose rewards are also bought back and burned as [explained here](https://docs.univ.money/what-is-universe/the-solution#innovative-buy-back-and-burn-mechanism). Wallets are subject to Smart Daily Limits as explained [here](https://docs.univ.money/technical-details/smart-daily-limits).

#### About Membership NFTs <a href="#about-the-planets" id="about-the-planets"></a>

Membership NFTs have the ability to be directly traded since they adhere to the ERC-721 standard. 15% commission goes back to the Treasury where we proceed continually to buying back and burning more GLDN.
