# üïç Grades and Initiations

Compounding your Grade tokens gives you extra rewards. As your daily reward grows and your loyalty to the order is tested, your will increase in Grade and be given new corresponding cards accordingly. The stronger the commitment, the higher the reward.

Compounding is available every 4 hours. Individual as well as all tokens may be compounded by using the button "Compound All" button.

The current grades for the aspirant are:

* **Probationer**: 0% bonus
* **Neophyte**: 1-5% bonus (increase by 1%)
* **Zelator**: 5-10% bonus (increase by 0.5%)
* **Practicus**: 10%-20% (increase by 0.1%)
* **Philosophus**: 20-30% (increase by 0.05%)
* **Dominus Liminis**: 30-40% (increase by 0.01%)

If you claim your rewards you will go back to Probationer but will keep what you have compounded.

For each tier, the bonus is calculated on top of the 4%. Example: for a Philosophus with 20% bonus it will be 4% + 20% of 4%.

The higher Grade you have, the more privileges and voting weight will be granted to your Grade tokens in the future.
