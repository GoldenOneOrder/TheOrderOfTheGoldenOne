# â˜€ Genesis

The Order of the Golden One is devoted towards generating passive income wealth strategies on the Avalanche blockchain for the benefit of its members by offering DaaS (DeFi as a service).&#x20;

The Order is powered by its initiates who agree to lock up their Temple Kin (KIN) token forever by minting "Grade" tokens that pay you back through perpetual yield at a high APR. Grade Tokens from The Order can be compounded to earn extra rewards.

Grade tokens can be transferred, exchanged, and traded outside the main KIN token. Grade tokens also offer solutions for governance through visibility on the blockchain and ability to participate in voting on proposals with voting power being decided by the total value an initiate as locked across all Grade tokens.

Grade tokens will also carry with them future benefits such as governance, voting, and unlocking new rooms.

The result is a protocol that is ideal for long-term investors seeking passive income at a high APR while offering sustainability and ease.

We intend to be generous in donation from the treasury towards charities that will benefit the earth and its inhabitants. Amazon Watch and Best Friends are two such organizations considered currently.
